# LinkedIn Get Viewers Formula

## Credits

Formula inspired from the https://github.com/jassics/learning-python repository.

## Premisses

- Linkedin account email and password.

- **Python3** : to build and execute this formula locally.

## Command

```bash
rit linkedin get viewers
```

```bash
rit linkedin get viewers --docker
```

## Description

This formula will return the list of today's LinkedIn viewers of the user profile.

## Notes

This implementation is a web scraping, therefore it might not work if LinkedIn changes the code or if LinkedIn block your IP (so don't run this formula too often).

You can also use Linkedin developer API, but currentlu it doesn't allow you to view the list without being a paid member.
